       <h4><strong><font size ="3">JUNIOR PYTHON DEVELOPER | BANGALORE | 2018 - 2022</font></strong></h4>
       
       During my time at AWATA Software, I led the end-to-end development of a medical inventory management system tailored for hospitals and clinics, with the goal of improving stock visibility, 
       reducing waste, and optimizing procurement. The project began with an in-depth analysis of existing manual workflows, where I collaborated with pharmacists, 
       procurement officers, and operations staff to identify pain points such as frequent stockouts, over-ordering, and losses due to expired supplies. 
       These insights shaped the system‚Äôs architecture, which I designed to be modular, scalable, and data-driven.
       I built the backend using Python and Flask, integrating SQLAlchemy to manage relational data models for items, batches, suppliers, and departments. 
       The system supported real-time stock updates, batch-level tracking, and automated reorder logic based on minimum thresholds and consumption trends. 
       I implemented barcode and QR code functionality using python-barcode and qrcode libraries, enabling fast item identification and reducing manual errors. 
       For the frontend, I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Chart.js to create a responsive dashboard that displayed key metrics such as stock levels, expiry alerts, 
       and usage analytics. To enhance decision-making, I incorporated predictive analytics using Scikit-learn. By analyzing historical consumption data, 
       the system could forecast future demand across departments like ICU, OPD, and Surgery, helping procurement teams plan smarter and avoid overstocking. 
       I also built modules for expiry tracking and waste logging, with automated alerts for near-expiry items and disposal records for compliance audits. 
       Scheduled tasks using APScheduler and cron jobs ensured timely notifications and monthly reporting without manual intervention.Security and data integrity were critical, 
       so I implemented role-based access control using Flask-Login, encrypted sensitive data with bcrypt, and validated user inputs with WTForms. 
       The system supported multiple user roles - including pharmacists, admins, and auditors - each with tailored permissions and views. 
       I also developed supplier performance tracking, logging delivery timelines, cost metrics, and reliability scores to help optimize vendor selection.
       The impact was substantial: the system reduced stockouts by 40%, improved inventory turnover by 25%, 
       and contributed to a ‚Çπ20+ Lakhs revenue boost through smarter procurement and reduced wastage. Beyond technical delivery, 
       I conducted user training sessions, created documentation, and maintained feedback loops to ensure the system was intuitive and aligned with real-world workflows. 
       This project not only strengthened my skills in full-stack development, data analytics, and automation, 
       but also deepened my understanding of how technology can drive operational excellence in healthcare environments.
